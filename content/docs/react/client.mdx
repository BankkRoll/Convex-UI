## Installation

<BlockItem
  name="convex-client-react"
  description="Convex Client for React SPA"
/>

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="convex-client-react" />

## Usage

This block installs a Convex client for connecting your React project to Convex. It's designed for use in client-side components with real-time data synchronization.

If you've already set up a Convex client in your project, you can just continue using that existing setup.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variable in your `.env.local` file:

<CodeBlock language="env">{`VITE_CONVEX_URL=`}</CodeBlock>

**For local development:** Simply run `npx convex dev` which will automatically configure this environment variable. No dashboard or account needed to get started!

When you're ready to deploy, you can find your production URL in your [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) under your project settings.

### Provider setup

Wrap your app with the Convex provider to enable real-time queries throughout your application:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">
{`import { ConvexAuthProvider } from "@/lib/convex/provider";

function App() {
return (

<ConvexAuthProvider>
  <YourApp />
</ConvexAuthProvider>
); }`}

</CodeBlock>

## Local Development

Convex makes local development simple:

1. Run `npx convex dev` to start your local Convex backend
2. Your schema is defined in `convex/schema.ts` (create this file if it doesn't exist)
3. All backend functions live in the `convex/` directory
4. Changes are automatically synced in real-time

No dashboard needed, no complex configuration. Everything works locally first!
