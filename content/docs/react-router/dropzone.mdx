## Introduction

Uploading files should be easy—this component handles the tricky parts for you.

The File Upload component makes it easy to add file uploads to your app, with built-in support for drag-and-drop, file type restrictions, image previews, and configurable limits on file size and number of files. All the essentials, ready to go.

**Features**

- Drag-and-drop support
- Multiple file uploads
- File size and count limits
- Image previews for supported file types
- MIME type restrictions
- Invalid file handling
- Success and error states with clear feedback
- Automatic upload to Convex Storage

## Usage

Simply add the `<Dropzone />` component to your page and it will handle the rest. Use the `useConvexUpload` hook for control over file uploads.

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{`import {
  Dropzone,
  DropzoneContent,
  DropzoneEmptyState,
} from "@/components/dropzone";
import { useConvexUpload } from "@/hooks/use-convex-upload";

const FileUploadDemo = () => {
const props = useConvexUpload({
allowedMimeTypes: ["image/*"],
maxFiles: 2,
maxFileSize: 1000 _ 1000 _ 10, // 10MB,
});

return (

<div className="w-[500px]">
  <Dropzone {...props}>
    <DropzoneEmptyState />
    <DropzoneContent />
  </Dropzone>
</div>
); };

export { FileUploadDemo };`}</CodeBlock>

## How it works

The upload process uses Convex's file storage system:

1. **Generate upload URL**: The hook calls a Convex mutation to generate a secure upload URL
2. **Upload file**: The file is uploaded directly to Convex Storage using the generated URL
3. **Save metadata**: After upload, file metadata (storage ID, name, size, type) is saved to your Convex database

<CodeBlock language="ts">{`// Example Convex functions for file upload
// convex/files.ts

import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const generateUploadUrl = mutation(async (ctx) => {
  return await ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl();
});

export const saveFile = mutation({
  args: {
    storageId: v.id("_storage"),
    name: v.string(),
    size: v.number(),
    type: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.insert("files", args);
  },
});`}</CodeBlock>

## Props

| Prop               | Type       | Default | Description                        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `allowedMimeTypes` | `string[]` | `[]`    | The MIME types to allow for upload |
| `maxFiles`         | `number`   | `1`     | Maximum number of files to upload  |
| `maxFileSize`      | `number`   | `1000`  | Maximum file size in bytes         |
