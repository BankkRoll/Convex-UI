## Installation

<BlockItem
  name="convex-client-laravel"
  description="Convex Client for Laravel"
/>

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="convex-client-laravel" />

## Usage

This block installs a Convex client for connecting your Laravel project to Convex. It's designed for use in client-side components with real-time data synchronization, typically through Inertia.js or Livewire with React.

If you've already set up a Convex client in your project, you can just continue using that existing setup.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variable in your `.env` file:

<CodeBlock language="env">{`VITE_CONVEX_URL=`}</CodeBlock>

**For local development:** Simply run `npx convex dev` which will automatically configure this environment variable. No dashboard or account needed to get started!

When you're ready to deploy, you can find your production URL in your [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) under your project settings.

### Provider setup

Laravel uses Vite for frontend asset bundling. Wrap your React components with the Convex provider to enable real-time queries throughout your application:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">
{`import { ConvexAuthProvider } from "@/lib/convex/provider";

function App() {
return (

<ConvexAuthProvider>
  <YourApp />
</ConvexAuthProvider>
); }`}

</CodeBlock>

### Inertia.js integration

If you're using Inertia.js with React, wrap your app in the main entry file (typically `resources/js/app.tsx`):

<CodeBlock language="tsx">
{`import { createInertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/react';
import { ConvexAuthProvider } from "@/lib/convex/provider";

createInertiaApp({
resolve: (name) => {
const pages = import.meta.glob('./Pages/\*_/_.tsx', { eager: true });
return pages[\`./Pages/\${name}.tsx\`];
},
setup({ el, App, props }) {
createRoot(el).render(

<ConvexAuthProvider>
  <App {...props} />
</ConvexAuthProvider>
); }, });`}

</CodeBlock>

## Local Development

Convex makes local development simple:

1. Run `npx convex dev` to start your local Convex backend
2. Your schema is defined in `convex/schema.ts` (create this file if it doesn't exist)
3. All backend functions live in the `convex/` directory
4. Changes are automatically synced in real-time

No dashboard needed, no complex configuration. Everything works locally first!
